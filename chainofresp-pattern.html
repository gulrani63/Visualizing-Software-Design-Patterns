<h3>Chain Of Responsibility Pattern</h3>
                <p>The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a design pattern in software engineering that allows a series of objects to handle a request progressively. It decouples the sender of a request from its receiver(s) by allowing multiple objects to process the request in a chain until it's handled or reaches the end of the chain. It's used to achieve flexibility in handling requests without coupling the sender to specific receiver implementations.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chain_of_responsibility_pattern" target="_blank" style="color: inherit;">Learn more</a>.</p>
                <h5>Key Characteristics</h5>
                <p>Key characteristics of the chain of the responsibility pattern include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                       <b>Handler Interface: </b>The pattern defines a common interface for all handlers in the chain, ensuring they have a handle_request method to process incoming requests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <b>Concrete Handlers: </b>Concrete classes that implement the handler interface. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it along the chain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Successor: </b>Each handler in the chain holds a reference to its successor (next handler) in the chain. If the current handler can't process the request, it forwards it to the successor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Responsibility: </b>Each handler has a specific responsibility, and the chain's structure determines the order in which handlers are invoked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Client: </b>The client creates the chain and initiates the request, typically starting with the first handler in the chain.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h5>Example</h5>
                <p>A real-world example of the Chain of Responsibility pattern can be found in software frameworks that implement event handling, such as user interfaces. Consider a graphical user interface where various UI elements (buttons, checkboxes, etc.) can respond to user interactions like clicks. The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be applied to handle these events in a systematic way.
