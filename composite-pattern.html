<h3>Composite Pattern</h3>
                <p>The Composite pattern is a design pattern in software engineering that lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. The pattern is used when you have a structure that can be represented as a hierarchical tree and you want to apply the same operations to individual objects and their compositions.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/composite_pattern" target="_blank" style="color: inherit;">Learn more</a>.</p>
                <h5>Key Characteristics</h5>
                <p>Key characteristics of the Composite pattern include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                       <b>Component: </b>The pattern defines an abstract base class (or interface) called the "Component" that declares the common interface for all concrete elements in the composition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <b>Leaf: </b>"Leaf" components represent individual objects that have no children in the composition hierarchy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Composite: </b>  "Composite" components represent containers that can hold other components, including both leaves and other composites.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Recursive Structure: </b>The composition forms a recursive structure, where both individual objects and compositions can have children.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Uniformity: </b>The pattern allows clients to treat single objects and compositions of objects uniformly by using the same interface for both.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h5>Example</h5>
                <p> A real-world example of the Composite pattern can be found in graphical user interface (GUI) frameworks. Imagine you're building a GUI framework that consists of various graphical elements such as windows, buttons, and panels. These elements can be arranged hierarchically to create complex layouts.
