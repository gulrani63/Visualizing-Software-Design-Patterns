<h3>Builder Pattern</h3>
                <p>Imagine you are building a system for constructing different types of computer systems. Each computer consists of a CPU, memory, storage, and possibly additional features. You want to use the Builder pattern to create various types of computers while keeping the construction process consistent.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/builder_pattern" target="_blank" style="color: inherit;">Learn more</a>.</p>
                <h5>Key Characteristics</h5>
                <p>Key characteristics of the Builder pattern include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                       <b>Separation of Concerns:</b>The pattern separates the construction logic from the actual representation of the object being built, allowing for more flexible construction processes.</li>
                    <li>
                       <b>Stepwise Construction:</b>The builder pattern involves a stepwise approach to constructing an object. Each step corresponds to building a part of the object.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Common Interface:</b>The pattern often uses a common interface for different builders. This interface typically declares methods for constructing each part of the object.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Director (Optional): </b>A director class may be used to guide the step-by-step construction process, invoking the builder's methods in a specific order.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Variety of Representations:</b>The builder pattern allows different concrete builders to create objects with different structures or features while using the same construction process.
                    </li>
                </ol>
